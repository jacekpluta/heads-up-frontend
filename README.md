2. On the screen a text will appear. The other players have to describe the entry to the active player, without mentioning any word from the actual entry. 
3. Once the entry is guessed the active player tilts phone forward and a new entry will be shown. 
4. When the active player clicks on the screen, the current entry will be skipped and a new entry will be shown.
