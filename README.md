# Heads Up App
> Heads Up is a web game application where players guess words or phrases that appear on the
 mobile held to their foreheads by watching the other players act it out or give hints as time counted down. 
 The aim is to get as many words/phrases correct.

Unfortunately game only works on mobile devices with motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).


You choose a category and one person holds the phone/tablet in front of his/her head.
On the screen a text will appear. The other players have to describe the question to the active player, without mentioning any word from the actual question.
Once the question is guessed the active player tilts phone forward and a new question will be shown.
When the active player clicks on the screen, the current question will be skipped and a new question will be shown.
For every round there is a time limit and the goal is to guess as many questions as possible.
This web app take the concept of mobile app Heads Up!
