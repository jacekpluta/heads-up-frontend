Heads-Up Clone
A mobile device with motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope ) is recommended.

How to play
The game is to be played in a group > 2.

You choose a category/tag and one person holds the phone/tablet in front of his/her head.
On the screen a text will appear. The other players have to describe the entry to the active player, without mentioning any word from the actual entry.
Once the entry is guessed the active player tilts phone forward and a new entry will be shown.
When the active player clicks on the screen, the current entry will be skipped and a new entry will be shown.
For every round there is a time limit and the goal is to guess as many Entry as possible.
This web app take the concept of mobile app Heads Up!
